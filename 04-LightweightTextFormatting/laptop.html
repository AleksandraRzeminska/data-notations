<h2 id="types-of-laptops">2. Types of laptops</h2>
<p>Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have
changed significantly, resulting in a variety of visually and
technologically differing subclasses.</p>
<p>Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably Ultrabook),
hard distinctions between these classes were rare, and their usage has
varied over time and between sources.</p>
<p>Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly
used, with sizes distinguished largely by the size of the screen.</p>

<p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop
counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile
use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops
limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of
desktop components, although that difference has increasingly
narrowed.</p>
<p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or
upgradable by the end-user, except for components that can be detached;
in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. In
the past, many laptops featured socketed processors but as of 2025
virtually all laptops use processors that are soldered to the
motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM that is soldered to the
motherboard and cannot be easily replaced. 1. <a
